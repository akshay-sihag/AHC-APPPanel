## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. The API key must be included in every request.

### API Key Format

API keys must start with the prefix: `ahc_live_sk_`

Example: `ahc_live_sk_abc123xyz789...`

### Authentication Methods

You can send the API key using either of these methods:

#### Method 1: X-API-Key Header (Recommended)
```http
X-API-Key: ahc_live_sk_your_api_key_here
```

#### Method 2: Authorization Bearer Header
```http
Authorization: Bearer ahc_live_sk_your_api_key_here
```

### Getting an API Key

API keys are generated and managed through the admin dashboard at `/dashboard/settings/api-keys`. Only administrators can create and manage API keys.

---

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to your deployment URL:

**Production:** `https://your-domain.com/api`

**Development:** `http://localhost:3000/api`

## Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Setup

To enable push notifications in your Android app, you need to set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM). Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Add project" or select an existing project
3. Enter your project name and follow the setup wizard
4. Enable Google Analytics (optional but recommended)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 2: Add Android App to Firebase

1. In your Firebase project, click "Add app" and select Android
2. Enter your Android package name (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp`)
3. Enter app nickname (optional)
4. Enter SHA-1 certificate fingerprint (optional for now, required for production)
5. Click "Register app"

### Step 3: Download Configuration File

1. Download `google-services.json` file
2. Place it in your Android app's `app/` directory (not in `src/`)
3. The file should be at: `app/google-services.json`

### Step 4: Add Firebase SDK to Android App

**In your `build.gradle` (Project level):**
```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        // Add this line
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.4.0'
    }
}
```

**In your `build.gradle` (App level):**
```gradle
plugins {
    id 'com.android.application'
    // Add this line
    id 'com.google.gms.google-services'
}

dependencies {
    // Add Firebase Cloud Messaging
    implementation 'com.google.firebase:firebase-messaging:23.3.1'
    // Add Firebase BOM for version management
    implementation platform('com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.7.0')
}
```

### Step 5: Get FCM Token in Android App

Create a service to get the FCM token:

```kotlin
// FirebaseMessagingService.kt
import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessaging
import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService
import com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage

class MyFirebaseMessagingService : FirebaseMessagingService() {
    
    override fun onNewToken(token: String) {
        // Send token to your server
        sendTokenToServer(token)
    }
    
    override fun onMessageReceived(remoteMessage: RemoteMessage) {
        // Handle received push notification
        remoteMessage.notification?.let {
            // Show notification
            showNotification(it.title, it.body, it.imageUrl)
        }
    }
    
    private fun sendTokenToServer(token: String) {
        // Call your API to register the token
        // POST /api/app-users/fcm-token
    }
}
```

**Get FCM Token:**
```kotlin
FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().token.addOnCompleteListener { task ->
    if (!task.isSuccessful) {
        Log.w(TAG, "Fetching FCM registration token failed", task.exception)
        return@addOnCompleteListener
    }
    
    // Get new FCM registration token
    val token = task.result
    Log.d(TAG, "FCM Registration Token: $token")
    
    // Send token to server
    sendTokenToServer(token)
}
```

### Step 6: Register Token with API

When you receive the FCM token, register it with the API:

```kotlin
fun registerFCMToken(wpUserId: String, email: String, fcmToken: String) {
    val requestBody = JSONObject().apply {
        put("wpUserId", wpUserId)
        put("email", email)
        put("fcmToken", fcmToken)
    }
    
    val request = Request.Builder()
        .url("$baseUrl/api/app-users/fcm-token")
        .post(requestBody.toString().toRequestBody("application/json".toMediaType()))
        .addHeader("X-API-Key", apiKey)
        .build()
    
    client.newCall(request).enqueue(object : Callback {
        override fun onResponse(call: Call, response: Response) {
            if (response.isSuccessful) {
                Log.d(TAG, "FCM token registered successfully")
            }
        }
        
        override fun onFailure(call: Call, e: IOException) {
            Log.e(TAG, "Failed to register FCM token", e)
        }
    })
}
```

### Step 7: Configure FCM in Admin Dashboard (Server-Side Setup)

The server now uses **Firebase Cloud Messaging API v1** (not the legacy API). You need to configure service account credentials.

#### Option A: Using Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)

1. **Get Service Account Key:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Your Project
   - Click the gear icon → Project Settings
   - Go to "Service Accounts" tab
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - Download the JSON file

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - Set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable to the JSON content as a string:
   ```env
   FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT='{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-id",...}'
   ```
   - OR set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the file path:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/service-account-key.json
   ```

3. **Configure Project ID in Dashboard:**
   - Go to your admin dashboard → Settings → WooCommerce tab
   - Scroll to "Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Settings"
   - Enter your Firebase Project ID (from Firebase Console → Project Settings → General)
   - Click "Save Settings"

#### Option B: Using Dashboard UI (For Testing/Development)

1. Go to your admin dashboard → Settings → WooCommerce tab
2. Scroll to "Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Settings"
3. Enter your Firebase Project ID (from Firebase Console → Project Settings → General)
4. **Note:** The FCM Server Key field is deprecated. For production, use service account credentials via environment variables as described in Option A.
5. Click "Save Settings"

### Step 8: Get Firebase Project ID and Service Account

1. **Get Project ID:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Your Project
   - Click the gear icon → Project Settings
   - Go to "General" tab
   - Copy the "Project ID"

2. **Get Service Account Key (Required for FCM API v1):**
   - In the same Project Settings page, go to "Service Accounts" tab
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - A JSON file will be downloaded
   - This file contains your service account credentials needed for the new FCM API v1
   - **Important:** Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control

3. **Configure on Server:**
   - Set the service account JSON as an environment variable (see Step 7, Option A)
   - The server will automatically use FCM API v1 (no legacy API)

### Step 9: Test Push Notifications

1. Create a notification in the admin dashboard (Dashboard → Notifications)
2. Make sure the notification is set to "Active"
3. The push notification will be automatically sent to all users with registered FCM tokens
4. Users should receive the notification on their Android devices

### Important Notes

- **FCM API v1**: The server now uses Firebase Cloud Messaging API v1 (not the legacy API). This is automatically handled by Firebase Admin SDK.
- **Service Account Required**: For production, you must configure service account credentials via environment variables. The legacy server key method is deprecated.
- **Token Refresh**: FCM tokens can change. Always listen for `onNewToken()` and re-register the token
- **Token Removal**: Call the DELETE endpoint when user logs out to stop receiving notifications
- **Error Handling**: Handle invalid token errors and remove them from your local storage
- **Background Notifications**: Configure notification channels for Android 8.0+
- **Production**: For production apps, you'll need to add your app's SHA-1 certificate fingerprint in Firebase Console
- **Security**: Never commit service account JSON files to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management

### Android Notification Channel Setup

For Android 8.0+ (API 26+), create a notification channel:

```kotlin
private fun createNotificationChannel() {
    if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.O) {
        val channelId = "default"
        val channelName = "Default Notifications"
        val channelDescription = "Default notification channel"
        val importance = NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH
        
        val channel = NotificationChannel(channelId, channelName, importance).apply {
            description = channelDescription
            enableLights(true)
            lightColor = Color.BLUE
            enableVibration(true)
        }
        
        val notificationManager = getSystemService(NotificationManager::class.java)
        notificationManager.createNotificationChannel(channel)
    }
}
```

### Admin Dashboard UI Configuration

To configure FCM settings through the admin dashboard:

1. **Navigate to Settings:**
   - Log in to the admin dashboard
   - Go to **Settings** (in the sidebar menu)
   - Click on the **WooCommerce** tab

2. **Configure FCM Settings:**
   - Scroll down to the **"Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) Settings"** section
   - Enter your **Firebase Project ID** (required)
     - This can be found in Firebase Console → Project Settings → General tab
   - The **FCM Server Key** field is now deprecated and disabled
     - The server uses FCM API v1 which requires service account credentials
     - Service account must be configured via environment variables (see Step 7)

3. **Save Settings:**
   - Click **"Save Settings"** button at the bottom of the page
   - Your Firebase Project ID will be saved

4. **Important Notes:**
   - The dashboard UI only stores the Project ID
   - Service account credentials must be configured on the server via environment variables
   - The FCM Server Key field is shown but disabled (deprecated)
   - For production, always use environment variables for service account credentials

### Troubleshooting

- **No notifications received**: 
  - Check that FCM token is registered and notification is active
  - Verify service account credentials are properly configured on the server
  - Check server logs for FCM initialization errors
  - Verify Firebase Project ID is correctly set in dashboard settings
- **Token registration fails**: Verify API key is correct and user exists
- **Notifications not showing**: Check notification channel setup and app permissions
- **Token invalid errors**: Token may have expired, re-register the token
- **FCM initialization errors**: 
  - Verify `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is set correctly
  - Check that the service account JSON is valid and has proper permissions
  - Ensure Firebase Project ID matches the service account project
  - Verify Project ID is set in dashboard settings
- **Legacy API errors**: The server no longer uses the legacy FCM API. Make sure service account credentials are configured for FCM API v1
- **Dashboard shows deprecated warning**: This is expected. The FCM Server Key field is disabled because the server uses FCM API v1

Retrieve all active frequently asked questions (FAQs) for display in the mobile app.

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/faqs/public`

**Headers:**
```http
X-API-Key: ahc_live_sk_your_api_key_here
```

**Example Request:**
```http
GET /api/faqs/public
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "faqs": [
    {
      "id": "clx123abc456",
      "question": "How do I track my weight?",
      "answer": "You can log your weight by going to the Weight Log section and tapping the 'Add Weight' button. Enter your current weight and the app will automatically calculate the change from your previous entry.",
      "order": 1,

**Error Responses:**
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

**Example Usage (JavaScript/TypeScript):**
```typescript
async function fetchFAQs() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/faqs/public', {
      method: 'GET',
      headers: {
        'X-API-Key': 'ahc_live_sk_your_api_key_here',
      },
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const data = await response.json();
    
    if (data.success) {
      console.log(`Fetched ${data.total} FAQs`);
      data.faqs.forEach((faq) => {
        console.log(`Q: ${faq.question}`);
        console.log(`A: ${faq.answer}`);
      });
      return data.faqs;
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching FAQs:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**Example Usage (Kotlin/Android):**
```kotlin
suspend fun fetchFAQs(): List<FAQ> {
    val client = OkHttpClient()
    val request = Request.Builder()
        .url("https://your-domain.com/api/faqs/public")
        .addHeader("X-API-Key", "ahc_live_sk_your_api_key_here")
        .get()
        .build()

    val response = client.newCall(request).execute()
    
    if (!response.isSuccessful) {
        throw IOException("Unexpected code ${response.code}")
    }

    val responseBody = response.body?.string()
    val json = JSONObject(responseBody ?: "")
    
    if (json.getBoolean("success")) {
        val faqsArray = json.getJSONArray("faqs")
        val faqs = mutableListOf<FAQ>()
        
        for (i in 0 until faqsArray.length()) {
            val faqJson = faqsArray.getJSONObject(i)
            faqs.add(
                FAQ(
                    id = faqJson.getString("id"),
                    question = faqJson.getString("question"),
                    answer = faqJson.getString("answer"),
                    order = faqJson.getInt("order"),
                    createdAt = faqJson.getString("createdAt")
                )
            )
        }
        
        return faqs
    } else {
        throw Exception("Failed to fetch FAQs")
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

All API endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

### Error Response Structure

```json
{
  "error": "Error message describing what went wrong",
  "details": "Additional error details (only in development mode)"
}
```

### HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Request successful
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters or missing required fields
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing API key
- `403 Forbidden`: Access denied (e.g., order doesn't belong to user)
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `409 Conflict`: Resource conflict (e.g., duplicate registration)
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

### Error Handling Best Practices

1. **Always check the HTTP status code** before processing the response
2. **Handle 401 errors** by prompting the user to re-authenticate
3. **Log error details** for debugging (but don't display sensitive information to users)
4. **Implement retry logic** for network errors (with exponential backoff)
5. **Show user-friendly error messages** based on the error type

### Example Error Handling (Flutter/Dart)

```dart
try {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.parse('$baseUrl/api/woocommerce/blogs'),
    headers: {
      'X-API-Key': apiKey,
    },
  );

  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    final data = json.decode(response.body);
    // Process successful response
    final blogs = data['blogs'] as List;
    final fromCache = data['fromCache'] ?? false;
    // Use blogs data...
  } else if (response.statusCode == 401) {
    // Handle unauthorized - invalid API key
    throw Exception('Invalid API key. Please contact support.');
  } else {
    final error = json.decode(response.body);
    throw Exception(error['error'] ?? 'An error occurred');
  }
} catch (e) {
  // Handle network errors, timeouts, etc.
  print('Error: $e');
}
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. API Key Security

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Store API keys securely (use secure storage on mobile devices)
- Rotate API keys periodically
- Use different API keys for development and production

### 2. Request Optimization

- **Use pagination** for large datasets (don't request all records at once)
- **Cache responses** when appropriate (blogs, categories, etc.)
- **Implement request debouncing** for search functionality
- **Use appropriate page sizes** (default limits are optimized)

### 3. Data Handling

- **Validate data** before sending to the API
- **Handle null values** appropriately
- **Parse dates correctly** (ISO 8601 format)
- **Display loading states** during API calls

### 4. Network Handling

- **Implement timeout handling** (recommended: 30 seconds)
- **Handle offline scenarios** gracefully
- **Retry failed requests** with exponential backoff
- **Show appropriate error messages** to users

### 5. User Experience

- **Show loading indicators** during API calls
- **Provide feedback** for user actions (success/error messages)
- **Implement pull-to-refresh** for lists
- **Cache frequently accessed data** locally

---

## Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no strict rate limits implemented. However, to ensure optimal performance:

- **Avoid making excessive requests** in a short time period
- **Implement client-side caching** to reduce API calls
- **Batch requests** when possible
- **Use pagination** instead of fetching all data at once

If you experience performance issues, contact the administrator to review API usage patterns.
